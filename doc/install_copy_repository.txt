How to install CopyRepository

1. customize config/copyRepository.xml

2. customize known_hosts.dat - this file should contain the public keys of
    the virtual machines you are trying to connect to.

    One way to get those is by connecting by SSH from one VM to the other and
    accepting the other's key. Then you will find it as the last line in
    /home/cinnamon/.ssh/known_hosts
    If your VM encrypts this key as:
        |1|43JWay+e3dYDoe/ECmc10+U1HkA=|7gxtxQ+VtB0Q+I6BO2OX8Y8aFGE= ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAA...==
    you should copy this line and replace the part from the start of the line to the first space
    with the ip number of the VM:
        172.16.13.143 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAA...==

3. copy root.authorized_keys to both VMs as /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
  (this can be done via:)
  > sudo bash
  > mkdir /root/.ssh
  > cp /tmp/root.authorized_keys /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
  > chmod +Rv 0600 /root/.ssh

4. copy cinnamon.authorized_keys to both VMs as /home/cinnamon/.ssh/authorized_keys
  if the file already exists, append the content of cinnamon.authorized_keys:
  cat /tmp/cinnamon.authorized_keys >> /home/cinnamon/.ssh/authorized_keys

How to run it:
java -jar cinnmamonTools.jar $configFile

IMPORTANT:
1. If you set <copyConfigFiles> to true, you must edit cinnamon_config.xml on the target
system so it contains the correct number or repositories. For example, if you copy
the repository "demo", and your source VM contains also a configured repository "cmn_test",
the cinnamon_config.xml will contain references to the cmn_test repository on the target
system, too.
2. This keys in authorized_keys allow anybody who has the private keys in config/*.key to
connect to the VMs as root. So you must not use this tool on VMs which are connected
directly to the internet. If you want to secure a VM after copying the repository, please
remove the authorized_keys file from both /home/cinnamon/.ssh and /root/.ssh.
